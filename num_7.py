NUMBER 7:

7A. 

I would say the importance of code review is essentially the same as a peer
review in literature. Code review helps you check for functionality in the 
same way that peer review in literature helps you check your content and 
the general strength of your argument in your literature piece. Checking 
for PEP8 in code review would be similar to checking for stylistic issues
in literature peer review. Just because the code runs without it, does not
mean you could not improve the quality of your code through a cleaner, 
more consistent style. 

7B. 
Acme could use Docker to run a container on each computer that already
contains all of the necessary dependencies to run the functions in this 
code without extra weight that could come from installing a whole, local 
operating system and without the trouble of having to worry about stability
or compatability. This would also guarantee that the version of the code
used in the container is consistent on all computers even if the other aspects
of the local environment are not.
